***Data Science and Machine Learning***

Both are currently highly valuable field in the world. This two field "Data Science" and "Machine Learning" are necessary in the data driven innovation,
decision-making and automation.

I am a student of IoT & Robotics Engineering Department. So I am trying to learning data science and machine learning to develop the solutions for real-world problem in this context. Here I will upload my daily works to keep the track.  
I will follow a learning path. In my first stage, I will learn Data Science tools:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

Then after learning this, I will go to the machine learning field where I'm gonna explore the different approach, models, neural networks and other things.
